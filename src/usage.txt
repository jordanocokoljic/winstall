Usage: winstall [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
  or:  winstall [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
  or:  winstall [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
  or:  winstall [OPTION]... -d DIRECTORY...

winstall is an almost drop in replacement for the GNU coreutils install program
for Windows. It should behave identically, excepting the handling for Linux
specifics, such as handling for SELinux contexts and Unix file permissions.

In the first three forms winstall will behave as install does, copy SOURCE to
DEST or multiple SOURCE(s) to the pre-existing DIRECTORY. In the 4th form
winstall will create all components of the given DIRECTORY(ies).

If an argument is parsed but ignored for compatibility with the original
install program this will be indicated. Mandatory arguments to long options are
mandatory for short options too.

  --backup[=CONTROL]            Make a backup of each file that would be
                                  overwritten or removed. If no CONTROL is
                                  provided, it will be read from the
                                  VERSION_CONTROL environment variable, if that
                                  is unset, "existing" will be used as default.

                                  The accepted values are:
                                  'none', 'off'     Never make backups.
                                  'numbered', 't'   Always make numbered
                                                      backups.
                                  'existing', 'nil' Make numbered backups of of
                                                      files that already have
                                                      them, simple backups of
                                                      the others.
                                  'simple', 'never' Always make simple backups.
                                                      Do not confuse 'never'
                                                      with 'none'.
  -b                            Like --backup but does not accept an argument.
  -c                            (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -C, --compare                 (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -D                            Create any missing parent directories for DEST
                                  or all the components of --target-directory
                                  then copy SOURCE to DEST.
  -d, --directory               Treat all arguments as directories, creating
                                  all components of the specified directories.
  --debug                       (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -g, --group=GROUP             (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -m, --mode=MODE               (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -o, --owner=OWNER             (ignored; unix compatibility)
  --preserve-context            (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -p, --preserve-timestamps     Set the time of last access and modificaiton of
                                  each copied file to match the original. If
                                  this is not used, then the copied files will
                                  have their last access and modification time
                                  set to the time of installation.
  -s, --strip                   (ignored; unix compatibility)
  --strip-program=PROGRAM       (ignored; unix compatibility)
  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX           Append SUFFIX to each backup file made with -b.
                                  If this is option is not specified, the value
                                  of the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment
                                  variable will be used. If that is not set
                                  then the default is '~'.
  -t, --target-directory=DIR    Specify the destination directory, this means
                                  that arguments will be interpreted instead as
                                  files to be copied (rather than the last
                                  argument being the directory to copy to).
  -T, --no-target-directory     Do not treat the last argument as a directory
                                  treat it as a normal file.
  -v, --verbose                 Print the name of each file before copying it
  -Z, --context[=CONTEXT]       (ignored; unix compatibility)
  --help                        Display this help and exit.
  --version                     Output version information and exit.
